PrintBinaryTree.hs

    Inspired from the Book "Haskell Programming from first prinicples" (Christopher Allen, Julie Mononuki)
    (Pure functional programming without fear or frustration)
    and also inspired from my son Robert  :)

    function 'printBinaryTree binTree' writes a svg file ./BinaryTreePrint.svg with svg graphics
    from a BinaryTree binTree
    to see graphics file drag it to a browser or open it with a program being able to handle svg format

    Purpose: For everybody who wants to visualize his BinaryTree(s)

... and there are more and more exercises!

Enjoy!
